### Pro

---> Here to put badges

I am a Java developer with 5 years of experience. During that time I designed and developed mainly in Java and participated in architecture decisions for IT systems in mid and big-size education, job board and insurance companies. Always eager to acquire new skills I worked in backend, frontend as well as integration. 

Simultaneously I actively tried to help my teams by changing the way we worked to maximize effectiveness and employees' motivation: that way I became a Scrum Master. Based on my experience I believe that properly implemented Scrum is the best (yet still simple) way to improve team's work. 

In future I would like to serve with my skills in a bigger scale becoming a leader or a technical manager.
