Working in IT? No matter how happy you are with your current job - you should actively look for a new one. But you do not want to change a job? Well, it is all about the chase.

It is not the most important to find a new job - you get multiple benefits just while looking for it on every single step in every recrutation process. Besides, postponing job seeking to the moment we cannot stand working in the current job or have to leave often leads us to quick, not very reasonable decisions. 

## Phase 1: Scanning through job offers

Do you think looking through the job offers is boring and treat it as a waste of time? Then probably you do it the wrong way. What I propose is to do it in two steps with separate goals in mind.

First try to generalize. Probably you have a vision of what you want to do. Step back a bit and think wider: what else would be acceptable, what could be a necessary step to open new positions in your career? Scan through the big number of offers (without getting into details) to distill all options you have. Usually it is enough to read job names and get into details only when we do not understand what the name represents. That will let you work out your possible career paths and make you able to choose one or more of them to focus on.

Then filter by your preferences and read the offers more carefully. Now you should have not more than 100-200 offers to read and based on that you can gather the real knowledge. Write down the skills you do not possess which you find repeated in multiple offers - consider acquiring them. Confront conditions found in the offers with what you have in the current job - list what would seriously lead you to considering the change.

With the two lists (of desired skills and of your expectations) you can have a nice knowledge base to plan some actions:
- get new skills to make more offers achievable
- talk with your employer about your job and try to negotiate better conditions (it is far more easier when you know your expectations are reasonable because based on the real offers from job market)
- apply for the jobs you highlighted and you are meeting the requirements

Watch out for unreliable offers put by headhunters gathering candidates' database.  You can try to filter them out by seeing very few requirements, no company name and sometimes very high salary.

## Phase 2: Preparing your self-presentation

Based on phase 1 you already should know which of your strengths (skills, education, experience, etc.) are more important and improve your position on the job market. Then you are prepared to update your social-network professional profile. Go to LinkedIn and maybe another more specialized social-networking professional service (e.g. GoldenLine for Polish job market) and create or update your profile. Fill it will all the strenghts you determined while scanning through job offers which could help you to get the position you want. Check if the order of sections of the profile (like: education, experience, skills, etc.) is proper -  the more strenghts a section contains the higher it should be placed. Look for your colleagues, classmates and friends and add them as your connections - there is always a chance some of them can help you in shaping your career. When you add them they will probably have a look on your profile and let you know if they have anything to propose you. Think if you can ask someone you worked with for an endorsement - it will prove you are a valuable candidate and enrich your profile with skills and characteristics you would rather not put by yourself (e.g. some soft skills, your attitude to work, engagement, etc.). Doing the update demands less effort and will help you to systemize professional info about you and will initiate passive job searching - headhunters will start to present you job offers which are sometimes not available on job boards.

Having done the social-network professional profile you can easily and with less effort prepare your CV template for active job searching. Fill it with all the information that could be interesting for a recruiter. Have in mind that it is just a template - you will not send it to apply for a job. 

## Phase 3: Applying for a job

To make your CV effective you should adjust it to every offer you want to reply. To convince you are the right candidate you should show that you meet at least all the mandatory requirements and have some extra probably desired strengths not mentioned in the offer. Copy your template and remove all the skills which do not fit the job offer. The more things you mention in the CV the more effort would be required to find the crucial ones and they would look less important. Sometimes you would also need to write a covering letter. That is fine because you can put in it the characteristics and skills which are not usually put in CV (the same that could be found in references) and you can prove you fit the position you apply for and the company you want to work for. Remember to put some specific info about the company to signalize you know it: its domain, products, etc. It will tell a recruiter that you really want this particular job.

You should pick quality over quantity in your applications. Prioritize the offers you selected by your preference and send the applications one by one. Check when the offers expire to be sure you apply in time. It is also a good idea to keep a copy of an offer to be able to prepare for an interview when the online offer is not available any more.

## Phase 4: Interview

If you are invited for an interview it is great - your CV passed the first selection exam (not bad, right?). Interviews could be very different so first you should recognize who will interview you. Based on that you will know if it will be a strictly technical interview or HR-style one. Remember that sometimes HR people are also the first line to verify your technical knowledge!

Before the technical review the requirements from the offer and be sure you are able to answer the basic questions about them. Before the HR-style one prepare the speech why it would be so great for you to work in the company and why it would be so great for the company to hire you. And of course be prepared to declare your salary expectations - do not have the same for all applications but adjust them to your preference of the offer (except thinking how much you need to earn think how much you want to earn for that single job).

Regarding the specific questions you could be asked, check the sites with interview questions according with your specific requirements (e.g. google 'Hibernate interview questions') and maybe some sites with more generic technical questions according with the target position.

The best way to prepare for an interview, both: the technical one or the HR-style one is to experience some interviews before. That is why it is really worth to apply for jobs continuously. There are not so many typical questions which occur on interviews - you just need to be sure you do your homework and find out the correct answers after every interview. Even if you fail you will be much better prepared for the next interview. And what is a great bonus: with every following interview you will feel less stressed, will be more self-confident and in short time will become master of being interviewed.

## Phase 5: Job proposal

Finally you will get a job proposal. It is important to ensure that a new job will be significantly better than the current one. It is not worth to change if you are not sure you will be much more satisfied. Analyze all the aspects that are important for you: elastic hours, stack of technologies, salary, etc. and think if there are any things which could influence your choice but you do not know them about the new job. Ask for them before you decide - most of us have tendency to assume that in the new job there will be as we imagine and the last thing we want is disappointment. So ask as many questions as you need - that is the best moment to do that!

You should also consider talking to your manager in the current job about your conditions change. It is very strong position when you have an open proposal with better conditions. If your current company / manager fails to improve your satisfaction and fails to draw a realistic scenario of improvement in the near future it is sure you will not be satisfied there in the long term perspective. So if you can have better job and have no vision of improvement in the current one - why not to change?

If you decide to change try to get some references (it would be the best to collect them on LinkedIn or another social network) while employees in the company you are leaving still remember you as a great worker.
Then switch to the new one, try hard to be the best and remember not to stop the process of continuous job searching even if it is hard to imagine that there could be a better place to work.

And now, get back to Phase 1.
